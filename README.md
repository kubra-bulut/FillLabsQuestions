# FILLLABSQUESTIONS 🚀
This project contains solutions to three different problems implemented in Golang. Each problem is structured as a separate module, making it modular and easy to maintain. 🛠️

## Questions Explanation 💡

1️⃣ Question 1: Sorting Words

Sorts a list of words based on the number of occurrences of the character "a" (in descending order). If two words have the same number of "a"s, they are sorted by length.

2️⃣ Question 2: Recursive Number Generation

Generates a sequence of numbers recursively based on a specific algorithm.

3️⃣ Question 3: Most Repeated Element

Finds the most repeated element in a given array.
